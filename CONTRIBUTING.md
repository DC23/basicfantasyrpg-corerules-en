# How to Contribute to the Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules Foundry Content Project

## Would you like to help keep the content updated?

- Great! However, right now, this project is going through some changes in management, and the primary focus is on repaying some technical debt caused by changes in the Foundry API. In the short term, we are not planning on changing the current BFPRG 3rd edition content beyond migrating the database formats to the new Foundry data structures (see the [README](./README.md) for a longer explanation). And longer-term, we're hoping to move away from manual data entry towards more automated data workflows. Stay tuned to see how that works out. We'll always need help in some form or other though.

## Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/DC23/basicfantasyrpg-corerules-en/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, then open a new one, preferrably using one of the templates. Include as much information as possible about the issue, when it occurs, and how to reproduce or find it. The templates provide guidance on exactly what information we find most helpful.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Come and talk to us at the [Basic Fantasy RPG Discord](https://discord.gg/5cra8aTRuh), in the [BFRPG Foundry Module Development channel](https://discord.com/channels/735808783493890058/1307906023444582430).

- Or, post a feature request [Issue](https://github.com/DC23/basicfantasyrpg-corerules-en/issues) here. You'll likely get more discussion with the community on Discord.

- We also have a [Workshop thread](https://www.basicfantasy.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5337) at the BFRPG Forum. Some discussion takes place there too, and I try to drop in at least once a week.

Remember, this is a volunteer effort, run by people with lives and committments. If we're moving too slowly for you, then we could always do with an extra pair of hands or eyes! We encourage you to pitch in and join the Basic Fantasy Project, either here or on one of the many other projects. The beating heart of the project is [the Basic Fantasy Forums](https://www.basicfantasy.org/forums/).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
