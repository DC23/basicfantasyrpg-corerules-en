Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the&nbsp;opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per&nbsp;day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age&nbsp;category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath&nbsp;may be used no more often than every other round, and&nbsp;the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time.&nbsp;The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are&nbsp;opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be&nbsp;used only on those opponents in front of the creature.&nbsp;Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any&nbsp;direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of&nbsp;damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points&nbsp;of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may&nbsp;be projected in any direction around the dragon, even&nbsp;behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those&nbsp;behind it.</p>\n<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a&nbsp;dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a&nbsp;&ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that type of dragon can use from&nbsp;the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon&nbsp;reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon&nbsp;learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other&nbsp;shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit&nbsp;dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three&nbsp;shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to&nbsp;the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and&nbsp;age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure&nbsp;given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are&nbsp;able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of&nbsp;&ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know&nbsp;Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many&nbsp;who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo;&nbsp;is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional&nbsp;roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon&nbsp;can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will&nbsp;learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for&nbsp;separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all&nbsp;dragons are covetous.&nbsp;They like to hoard wealth,&nbsp;collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems,&nbsp;jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large&nbsp;hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of&nbsp;their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food.&nbsp;For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance.&nbsp;Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks&nbsp;and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most&nbsp;monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average&nbsp;numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single&nbsp;individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do&nbsp;not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure&nbsp;amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of&nbsp;the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would&nbsp;have about double the given amount, while one of the&nbsp;next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth&nbsp;that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually&nbsp;flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest.&nbsp;Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack (surprising on a&nbsp;roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>\n<p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person&nbsp;as a cat plays with a mouse.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30'

Upon&nbsp;reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon&nbsp;learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other&nbsp;shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit&nbsp;dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three&nbsp;shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to&nbsp;the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and&nbsp;age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure&nbsp;given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are&nbsp;able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of&nbsp;&ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know&nbsp;Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many&nbsp;who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo;&nbsp;is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional&nbsp;roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon&nbsp;can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will&nbsp;learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for&nbsp;separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all&nbsp;dragons are covetous.&nbsp;They like to hoard wealth,&nbsp;collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems,&nbsp;jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large&nbsp;hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of&nbsp;their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food.&nbsp;For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance.&nbsp;Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks&nbsp;and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most&nbsp;monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average&nbsp;numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single&nbsp;individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do&nbsp;not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure&nbsp;amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of&nbsp;the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would&nbsp;have about double the given amount, while one of the&nbsp;next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth&nbsp;that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. Those having spellcasting ability make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are <strong>cloudkill</strong>, <strong>sleep</strong>, and <strong>slow</strong>.</p>\n<p>All gold dragons have the power to assume human form at will (in a manner equivalent to the spell <strong>polymorph self</strong>, but performed at will).</p>\n<p>Unlike many other dragons, gold dragons are not cruel and do not seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of gold dragons offering assistance to adventurers. They are, however, every bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold need not bother asking for a loan.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are immune to all poisons, as well as normal&nbsp;fire. They suffer only half damage from magical fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30 Fly 80 (20)","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Movement"},"saves":{"death":{"value":9},"wands":{"value":9},"paralysis":{"value":11},"breath":{"value":12},"spells":{"value":13}},"hitDice":{"size":"d8","number":11,"mod":9,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDice","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDiceAbbr"},"morale":{"value":10,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Morale"},"numberAppearing":{"value":"1, Wild 1, Lair 1d4","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.NumberAppearing"},"specialAbility":{"value":2,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.SpecialAbility"},"treasureType":{"value":"H","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.TreasureType"},"xp":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePointsAbbr"}},"token":{"name":"Gold Dragon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"hitPoints"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"1zzipOUBvNg2osTA","name":"Assume human form","type":"feature","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"","formula":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Formula"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"IBdF0S3hYvoHc47d","name":"Immune to Poison","type":"feature","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Immune to all poisons.</p>","formula":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Formula"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"JeqcPX2pI3l6gwrs","name":"Immune to Fire","type":"feature","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Immune to normal fire.

Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of &ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo; is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.</p>\n<p>Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>\n<p>Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait underwater.</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30'

Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the&nbsp;opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per&nbsp;day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age&nbsp;category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath&nbsp;may be used no more often than every other round, and&nbsp;the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time.&nbsp;The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are&nbsp;opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be&nbsp;used only on those opponents in front of the creature.&nbsp;Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any&nbsp;direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of&nbsp;damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points&nbsp;of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may&nbsp;be projected in any direction around the dragon, even&nbsp;behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those&nbsp;behind it.</p>\n<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a&nbsp;dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a&nbsp;&ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that type of dragon can use from&nbsp;the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward.

A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are&nbsp;able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of&nbsp;&ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know&nbsp;Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many&nbsp;who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo;&nbsp;is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional&nbsp;roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon&nbsp;can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will&nbsp;learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for&nbsp;separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all&nbsp;dragons are covetous.&nbsp;They like to hoard wealth,&nbsp;collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems,&nbsp;jewels, and magic items as possible.

They&nbsp;are the least intelligent of dragons, though this does not&nbsp;mean that they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for pleasure.</p>\n<p>White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down&nbsp;from aloft or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice.&nbsp;Typically, a white dragon begins with its icy breath&nbsp;weapon, then tries to eliminate a single opponent with a&nbsp;follow-up attack.</p>\n<p>White dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only half damage from magical cold or ice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30 Fly 80 (10)","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Movement"},"saves":{"death":{"value":10},"wands":{"value":11},"paralysis":{"value":12},"breath":{"value":14},"spells":{"value":15}},"hitDice":{"size":"d8","number":6,"mod":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDice","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDiceAbbr"},"morale":{"value":8,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Morale"},"numberAppearing":{"value":"1, Wild 1, Lair 1d4","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.NumberAppearing"},"specialAbility":{"value":2,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.SpecialAbility"},"treasureType":{"value":"H","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.TreasureType"},"xp":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePointsAbbr"}},"token":{"name":"White Dragon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"hitPoints"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"IUNlHnJldFbgOujZ","name":"Cold (Cone) Breath Weapon","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Width 30'</p>\n<p>Save vs. Dragon Breath halves damage</p>","price":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Price"},"weight":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Weight"},"bonusAb":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.BonusAttackBonus"},"damage":{"value":"6d8","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Damage","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.DamageAbbr"},"range":{"value":"80","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Range"},"size":{"value":"M","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Size"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"sobv9zyduW9estNV","name":"Claw","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"","price":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Price"},"weight":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Weight"},"bonusAb":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.BonusAttackBonus"},"damage":{"value":"1d4","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Damage","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.DamageAbbr"},"range":{"value":"Melee","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Range"},"size":{"value":"M","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Size"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"cLWoVHwPVcgBkzaJ","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"","price":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Price"},"weight":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Weight"},"bonusAb":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.BonusAttackBonus"},"damage":{"value":"2d8","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Damage","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.DamageAbbr"},"range":{"value":"Melee","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Range"},"size":{"value":"M","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Size"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"WSbTApemJIMn4jrz","name":"Tail","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"","price":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Price"},"weight":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Weight"},"bonusAb":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.BonusAttackBonus"},"damage":{"value":"1d4","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Damage","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.DamageAbbr"},"range":{"value":"Melee","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Range"},"size":{"value":"M","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Size"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"cE1e26b1Ax8tred7","name":"Immune to Cold","type":"feature","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Immune to normal cold, and take only half damage from magical cold or ice.</p>","formula":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Formula"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ibGMZPma8kUz3MmY":3},"flags":{}}

Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the&nbsp;opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per&nbsp;day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age&nbsp;category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath&nbsp;may be used no more often than every other round, and&nbsp;the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time.&nbsp;The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are&nbsp;opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be&nbsp;used only on those opponents in front of the creature.&nbsp;Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any&nbsp;direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of&nbsp;damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points&nbsp;of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may&nbsp;be projected in any direction around the dragon, even&nbsp;behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those&nbsp;behind it.</p>\n<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a&nbsp;dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a&nbsp;&ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that type of dragon can use from&nbsp;the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon&nbsp;reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon&nbsp;learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other&nbsp;shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit&nbsp;dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three&nbsp;shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to&nbsp;the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and&nbsp;age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure&nbsp;given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are&nbsp;able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of&nbsp;&ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know&nbsp;Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many&nbsp;who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo;&nbsp;is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional&nbsp;roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon&nbsp;can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will&nbsp;learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for&nbsp;separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all&nbsp;dragons are covetous.&nbsp;They like to hoard wealth,&nbsp;collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems,&nbsp;jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large&nbsp;hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of&nbsp;their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food.&nbsp;For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance.&nbsp;Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks&nbsp;and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most&nbsp;monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average&nbsp;numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single&nbsp;individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do&nbsp;not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure&nbsp;amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of&nbsp;the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would&nbsp;have about double the given amount, while one of the&nbsp;next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth&nbsp;that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually&nbsp;flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest.&nbsp;Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack (surprising on a&nbsp;roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>\n<p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person&nbsp;as a cat plays with a mouse.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30'

Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.</p>\n<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of &ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo; is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.</p>\n<p>Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>\n<p>Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait underwater.</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30'

Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the&nbsp;opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per&nbsp;day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age&nbsp;category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath&nbsp;may be used no more often than every other round, and&nbsp;the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time.&nbsp;The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are&nbsp;opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be&nbsp;used only on those opponents in front of the creature.&nbsp;Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any&nbsp;direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of&nbsp;damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points&nbsp;of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may&nbsp;be projected in any direction around the dragon, even&nbsp;behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those&nbsp;behind it.</p>\n<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a&nbsp;dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a&nbsp;&ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that type of dragon can use from&nbsp;the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon&nbsp;reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon&nbsp;learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other&nbsp;shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit&nbsp;dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three&nbsp;shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to&nbsp;the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and&nbsp;age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure&nbsp;given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are&nbsp;able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of&nbsp;&ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know&nbsp;Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many&nbsp;who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo;&nbsp;is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional&nbsp;roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon&nbsp;can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will&nbsp;learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for&nbsp;separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all&nbsp;dragons are covetous.&nbsp;They like to hoard wealth,&nbsp;collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems,&nbsp;jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large&nbsp;hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of&nbsp;their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food.&nbsp;For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance.&nbsp;Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks&nbsp;and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most&nbsp;monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average&nbsp;numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single&nbsp;individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do&nbsp;not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure&nbsp;amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of&nbsp;the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would&nbsp;have about double the given amount, while one of the&nbsp;next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth&nbsp;that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually&nbsp;flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest.&nbsp;Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack (surprising on a&nbsp;roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>\n<p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person&nbsp;as a cat plays with a mouse.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30'

When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability.

Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.</p>\n<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of &ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo; is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.</p>\n<p>Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>\n<p>Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid.

Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the&nbsp;opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per&nbsp;day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age&nbsp;category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath&nbsp;may be used no more often than every other round, and&nbsp;the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time.&nbsp;The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are&nbsp;opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be&nbsp;used only on those opponents in front of the creature.&nbsp;Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any&nbsp;direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of&nbsp;damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points&nbsp;of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may&nbsp;be projected in any direction around the dragon, even&nbsp;behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those&nbsp;behind it.</p>\n<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a&nbsp;dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a&nbsp;&ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that type of dragon can use from&nbsp;the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon&nbsp;reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon&nbsp;learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other&nbsp;shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit&nbsp;dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three&nbsp;shapes.</p>\n<p>The shapes are:</p>\n<p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>\n<p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to&nbsp;the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and&nbsp;age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure&nbsp;given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>\n<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are&nbsp;able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of&nbsp;&ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the chance that the dragon will know&nbsp;Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many&nbsp;who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo;&nbsp;is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional&nbsp;roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>\n<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon&nbsp;can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will&nbsp;learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for&nbsp;separately.</p>\n<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all&nbsp;dragons are covetous.&nbsp;They like to hoard wealth,&nbsp;collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems,&nbsp;jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large&nbsp;hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of&nbsp;their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food.&nbsp;For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance.&nbsp;Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks&nbsp;and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most&nbsp;monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average&nbsp;numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single&nbsp;individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do&nbsp;not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure&nbsp;amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of&nbsp;the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would&nbsp;have about double the given amount, while one of the&nbsp;next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth&nbsp;that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>\n<p>A dragon turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The turtle&rsquo;s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with golden highlights. An adult dragon turtle can measure from 100 to 200 feet from snout to tail. They are occasionally mistaken for rocky outcroppings or even small islands.</p>\n<p>Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and generally attack any creature that threatens their territory or looks like a potential meal. Though they are not true dragons, they do advance through the same sort of age categories as the true dragons do; however, each age category changes the dragon turtle's Hit Dice by 5.</p>\n<p>Due to their massive size, dragon turtles are immune to virtually all poisons.</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"10' (10') Swim 30' (15')","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Movement"},"saves":{"death":{"value":0},"wands":{"value":1},"paralysis":{"value":3},"breath":{"value":4},"spells":{"value":5}},"hitDice":{"size":"d8","number":30,"mod":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDice","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDiceAbbr"},"morale":{"value":10,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Morale"},"numberAppearing":{"value":"Wild 1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.NumberAppearing"},"specialAbility":{"value":2,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.SpecialAbility"},"treasureType":{"value":"H","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.TreasureType"},"xp":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePointsAbbr"}},"token":{"name":"Dragon Turtle","img":"modules/basicfantasyrpg-corerules-en/assets/tokens-monsters/dragon-turtle.png","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"hitPoints"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"kDZm4tBJEOJDArcn","name":"Immune to Poisons","type":"feature","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Due to their massive size, dragon turtles are immune to virtually all poisons.</p>","formula":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Formula"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"MrbUQBlzq24kAJj5","name":"Steam (Cloud) Breath Weapon","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"<p>Width 75'</p>\n<p>Save vs. Dragon Breath halves damage</p>","price":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Price"},"weight":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Weight"},"bonusAb":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.BonusAttackBonus"},"damage":{"value":"30d8","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Damage","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.DamageAbbr"},"range":{"value":"100","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Range"},"size":{"value":"M","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Size"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"Vrj6gm9Yp9ChAN7G","name":"Claw","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"","price":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Price"},"weight":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Weight"},"bonusAb":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.BonusAttackBonus"},"damage":{"value":"2d8","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Damage","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.DamageAbbr"},"range":{"value":"Melee","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Range"},"size":{"value":"M","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Size"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"Y6xcN4GE2th4vJbx","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"","price":{"value":"","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Price"},"weight":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Weight"},"bonusAb":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.BonusAttackBonus"},"damage":{"value":"10d6","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Damage","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.DamageAbbr"},"range":{"value":"Melee","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Range"},"size":{"value":"M","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Size"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PBX8yk3Fz19HfGi0":3},"flags":{}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ibGMZPma8kUz3MmY":3},"flags":{}}

Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>\n<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>\n<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>\n<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.</p>\n<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath).
