Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually wear short, carefully trimmed beards.</p>\n<p>Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30' range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.</p>\n<p>Gnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.</p>\n<p>Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and Magic-Users are equivalent to regular gnomish warriors statistically.</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"20, Unarmored 40","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Movement"},"saves":{"death":{"value":8},"wands":{"value":9},"paralysis":{"value":10},"breath":{"value":12},"spells":{"value":13}},"hitDice":{"size":"d8","number":7,"mod":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDice","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDiceAbbr"},"morale":{"value":8,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Morale"},"numberAppearing":{"value":"1d8, Wild 5d8, Lair 5d8","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.NumberAppearing"},"specialAbility":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.SpecialAbility"},"treasureType":{"value":"D","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.TreasureType"},"xp":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePointsAbbr"}},"ownership":{"default":0,"4NepM6JBrulMDol4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Gnome","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"hitPoints"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/basicfantasyrpg-corerules-en/assets/tokens-monsters/gnome.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"basicfantasyrpg","systemVersion":"r7","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1664135839518,"modifiedTime":1664137388638,"lastModifiedBy":"4NepM6JBrulMDol4"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"jwnmlcyPGErorGG9"}

Hobgoblins' eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather. Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair. They wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. As with most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.</p>\n<p>Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents.</p>\n<p>One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20', having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), adding a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) (movement &nbsp;is still 20') having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"30, Unarmored 40","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Movement"},"saves":{"death":{"value":12},"wands":{"value":13},"paralysis":{"value":14},"breath":{"value":15},"spells":{"value":17}},"hitDice":{"size":"d8","number":1,"mod":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDice","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDiceAbbr"},"morale":{"value":8,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Morale"},"numberAppearing":{"value":"1d6, Wild 2d4, Lair 4d8","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.NumberAppearing"},"specialAbility":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.SpecialAbility"},"treasureType":{"value":"Q, R each: D, K in Lair","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.TreasureType"},"xp":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePointsAbbr"}},"ownership":{"default":0,"4NepM6JBrulMDol4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Hobgoblin","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"hitPoints"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/basicfantasyrpg-corerules-en/assets/tokens-monsters/hobgoblin.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"basicfantasyrpg","systemVersion":"r7","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1664144105730,"modifiedTime":1664144602873,"lastModifiedBy":"4NepM6JBrulMDol4"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"y5wHbxt4d5aTewQk"}
