If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a <strong>sleep</strong> spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s)&nbsp;due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round.</p>","hitPoints":{"value":null,"max":null,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitPointsAbbr"},"initBonus":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.InitiativeBonus"},"move":{"value":"10","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Movement"},"saves":{"death":{"value":13},"wands":{"value":14},"paralysis":{"value":15},"breath":{"value":16},"spells":{"value":18}},"hitDice":{"size":"d8","number":2,"mod":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDice","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.HitDiceAbbr"},"morale":{"value":11,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.Morale"},"numberAppearing":{"value":"1","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.NumberAppearing"},"specialAbility":{"value":1,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.SpecialAbility"},"treasureType":{"value":"None","label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.TreasureType"},"xp":{"value":0,"label":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePoints","abbr":"BASICFANTASYRPG.ExperiencePointsAbbr"}},"token":{"name":"Insect Swarm","img":"modules/basicfantasyrpg-corerules-en/assets/tokens-monsters/insect-swarm.png","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"hitPoints"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ibGMZPma8kUz3MmY":3},"flags":{}}
