  description: >-
    <p><strong>Hide</strong> permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area
    large enough to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief
    always believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the roll. A
    Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this ability to work.</p>
