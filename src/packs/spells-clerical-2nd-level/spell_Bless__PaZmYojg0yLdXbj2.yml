  description: >-
    <p>This spell gives the caster and his or her allies (within a 50' radius of
    the caster) a bonus of +1 on attack rolls, morale checks (for monsters or
    NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical
    <strong>fear</strong>.</p>

    <p>The reverse of <strong>bless</strong> is called <strong>bane</strong>. It
    fills the caster's enemies (within a 50' radius) with fear and doubt,
    causing each affected creature to suffer a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls,
    morale checks, and saving throws against magical <strong>fear</strong>.</p>
