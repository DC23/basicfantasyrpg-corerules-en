  description: >-
    <p>This spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human or
    humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will not be
    affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware, and breathe
    normally, but cannot take any actions, including speech. A successful save
    vs. Spells will negate the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person,
    who makes his or her save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the
    creatures in the group may be affected.</p>

    <p>A winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls (if
    in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can&rsquo;t swim and may
    drown.</p>
