  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into
    existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range once per
    round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike, +1 point per three
    caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the caster&rsquo;s normal attack
    bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon
    creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the
    spell range, the Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct
    it, the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed by
    physical attacks, but <strong>dispel magic</strong>,
    <strong>disintegrate</strong>, or a <strong>rod of cancellation</strong>
    will dispel it.</p>
