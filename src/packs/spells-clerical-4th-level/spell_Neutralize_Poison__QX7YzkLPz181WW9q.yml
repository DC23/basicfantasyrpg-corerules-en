  description: >-
    <p>This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object
    touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison;
    if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature
    is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap,
    etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.</p>

    <p>Reversed, this spell becomes <strong>poison</strong>. The caster must
    make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must
    save vs. Poison or die. The caster's touch remains poisonous for 1 round per
    level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be
    affected by the reversed spell).</p>
