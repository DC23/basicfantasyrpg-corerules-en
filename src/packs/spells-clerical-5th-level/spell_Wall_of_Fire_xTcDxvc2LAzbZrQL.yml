  description: >-
    <p>An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into
    existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves
    of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and
    1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The
    wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster's turn each round
    to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1
    point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it.
    The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.</p>

    <p>The wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20' in length per caster level,
    or a ring with a radius up to 5' per caster level. The caster may choose to
    make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20' tall (as desired
    by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).</p>

    <p>If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are,
    each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells
    is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature
    is within 10' of the wall.</p>

    <p>The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within
    reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the
    standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.</p>
