  description: >-
    <p>Word of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her
    sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must designate the
    sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and it must be a very familiar
    place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10
    feet by 10 feet. The caster can be transported any distance within a plane
    but cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along objects or
    creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10 th.
    The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be
    transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one
    another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the
    caster).</p>

    <p>An unwilling creature can&rsquo;t be teleported by word of recall.
    Likewise, a creature&rsquo;s save vs. Spells prevents items in its
    possession from being teleported.</p>
