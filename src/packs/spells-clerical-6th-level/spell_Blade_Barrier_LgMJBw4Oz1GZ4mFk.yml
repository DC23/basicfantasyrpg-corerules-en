  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates a wall of whirling blades up to 20' long per caster
    level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5' per two
    levels. Either form will be up to 20 ft. high (as allowed by available
    space). Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per
    caster level (maximum 15d6), with a save vs. Death Ray reducing damage to
    half.</p>

    <p>If the caster evokes the barrier so that it appears where creatures are,
    each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such
    creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus
    take no damage by making a successful save vs. Death Ray.</p>

    <p>A blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) against attacks
    made through it.</p>
