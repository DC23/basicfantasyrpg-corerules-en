    <p>No. of Attacks: 1</p>

    <p>Damage: 1d4</p>

    <p>Dryads are female nature spirits; each is mystically bound to a single,
    enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who
    do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad's oak does not radiate
    magic. A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies;
    likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.</p>

    <p>A dryad's delicate features are much like a female elf's, though her
    flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves
    that changes color with the seasons. Although they are generally solitary,
    up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.</p>

    <p>Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are
    alluring -- they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish
    to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad can charm (as the spell
    <strong>charm person</strong>), attempting to gain control of the
    attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her
    tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.</p>
