    <p>This spell instantly transports the caster to a designated destination,
    which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is
    not possible. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed
    300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in
    contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although
    creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at
    least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling
    creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the
    caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature.
    Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature's
    possession from being teleported.</p>

    <p>The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the
    destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the
    teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make
    teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p>

    <p>To determine the results of this spell, roll d% and consult the table
    below. Below the table is an explanation of the terms used.</p>

    <p>Familiarity: &ldquo;Very familiar&rdquo; is a place where the caster has
    been very often and feels at home. &ldquo;Studied carefully&rdquo; is a
    place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the
    caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used
    to study the place for at least one hour. &ldquo;Seen casually&rdquo; is a
    place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is
    not very familiar. &ldquo;Viewed once&rdquo; is a place that the caster has
    seen once, possibly using magic.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;False destination&rdquo; is a place that does not truly exist or
    if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no
    longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be
    familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.</p>

    <p>On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.</p>

    <p>Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the
    destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the
    distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined
    randomly.</p>

    <p>Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that&rsquo;s visually or
    thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears
    in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the
    spell&rsquo;s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p>

    <p>Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have
    gotten &ldquo;scrambled.&rdquo; Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then
    reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll
    1d20+80. Each time &ldquo;Mishap&rdquo; comes up, the characters take more
    damage and must reroll.</p>
