  description: >-
    <p>This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead
    skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken commands. They remain
    animated until they are destroyed. The caster may animate a number of hit
    dice of undead equal to twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated
    skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for
    skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of
    the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the
    creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly
    intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.
    The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may normally
    control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or her level, regardless of
    how many times this spell is cast.</p>
