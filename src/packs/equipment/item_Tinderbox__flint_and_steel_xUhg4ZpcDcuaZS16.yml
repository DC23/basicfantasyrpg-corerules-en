  description: >-
    <p>A Tinderbox is generally purchased with a flint and steel; the flint, a
    piece of hard rock, is struck vigorously against a C-shaped piece of
    high-carbon steel. When done correctly, hot sparks will fly from the flint
    and steel into the tinder, hopefully starting a fire. The best tinder is a
    dried piece of prepared tinder fungus, carried in the tinderbox to keep it
    dry; char cloth, hemp rope, or even very dry grass can substitute if
    prepared tinder fungus is not available. The time required to start a fire
    should be determined by the GM according to the prevailing conditions; under
    ideal conditions, starting a fire with a flint, steel and tinder takes about
    a turn.</p>
