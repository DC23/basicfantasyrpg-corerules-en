  description: >-
    <p>Wineskin/Waterskin is a container for drinking water or wine; though
    generally water is taken into a dungeon or wilderness environment. The
    standard waterskin holds one quart of liquid, which is the minimum amount
    required by a normal character in a single day. If adventuring in the desert
    or other hot, dry areas, a character may need as much as ten times this
    amount. Note that the given 2 pound weight is for a full skin; an empty skin
    has negligible weight.</p>
