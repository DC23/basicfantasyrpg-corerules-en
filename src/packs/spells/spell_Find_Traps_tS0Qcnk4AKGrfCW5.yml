  description: >-
    <p>This spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both
    mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30&rsquo; of a trap, he
    or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue aura. The caster is not,
    however, able to detect certain natural hazards such as quicksand, a
    sinkhole, or unsafe walls of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow
    the caster with the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details
    about its type or nature.</p>
