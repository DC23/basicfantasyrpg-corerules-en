  description: >-
    <p>Each casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature
    who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two negative levels may be
    removed. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the <strong>Encounter</strong>
    section) for more details.</p>

    <p>Alternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score
    points. If applied to a character who has suffered temporary loss of ability
    points, it will restore up to 1d4 lost points to any one drained ability
    immediately. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of
    ability points, 1 point can be restored.</p>

    <p>Restoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as described for
    the spell <strong>raise dead</strong>).</p>
