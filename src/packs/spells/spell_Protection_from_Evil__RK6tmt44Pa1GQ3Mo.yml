  description: >-
    <p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental
    control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around
    the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and
    has three major effects.</p>

    <p>First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both
    these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil
    creatures. Note that the definition of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is left to the
    individual GM to decide.</p>

    <p>Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by
    a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the
    creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not
    prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it
    suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect.
    If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control
    does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled
    creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does
    not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.</p>

    <p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures
    (regardless of whether they are &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or not). This causes the
    natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil
    if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against
    contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack
    against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.</p>

    <p>Reversed, this spell becomes&nbsp;<strong>protection from good</strong>.
    It functions in all ways as described above, save that &ldquo;good&rdquo;
    creatures are kept away, rather than &ldquo;evil&rdquo; creatures.</p>
