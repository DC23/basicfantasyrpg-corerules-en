  description: >-
    <p>This spell functions exactly as <strong>protection from evil</strong>,
    but with a 10' radius rather than a 1' radius. All within the radius receive
    the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the
    spell is cast, receive the protection as well.</p>

    <p>Reversed, this spell becomes <strong>protection from good 10'
    radius</strong>, and functions exactly as the reversed form of
    <strong>protection from evil</strong>, except that it covers a 10' radius
    around the target rather than the normal 1' radius.</p>
