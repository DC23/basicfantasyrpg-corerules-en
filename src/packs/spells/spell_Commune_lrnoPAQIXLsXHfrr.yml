  description: >-
    <p>This spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or an
    extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no question per caster
    level. The ritual to cast this spell takes 1 turn to complete. The being
    contacted may or may not be omniscient, and further, though the being is
    technically allied with the caster, it may still not answer questions
    clearly or completely. These details are left to the GM's discretion.</p>
