  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1 full
    round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a 20' radius around
    the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells will reduce damage by half.
    The ice storm fills a vertical volume of 40', so creatures higher than that
    distance above the target spot are unaffected. A &ndash;20% penalty applies
    to each Listen roll made within the ice storm&rsquo;s effect, and all land
    movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the
    hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt). Any
    creature naturally resistant to cold takes half damage (or one-quarter
    damage if it makes its save).</p>
