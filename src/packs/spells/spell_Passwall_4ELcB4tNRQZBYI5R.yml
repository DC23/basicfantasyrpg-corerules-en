  description: >-
    <p>Passwall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but
    not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is up to 10 feet
    deep plus an additional 10 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (20
    feet at 12th, 30 feet deep at 15th, 40 feet deep at 18th). If the
    wall&rsquo;s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a
    single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall
    spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When
    passwall ends (due to duration, dispel magic, or caster's choice), creatures
    within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.</p>
