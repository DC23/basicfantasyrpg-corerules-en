  description: >-
    <p>Shield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force that hovers
    in front of the caster. It negates <strong>magic missile</strong> attacks
    directed at the caster, and improves the caster's Armor Class by +3 vs.
    melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The Armor Class benefits do not
    apply to attacks originating from behind the caster, but <strong>magic
    missiles</strong> are warded off from all directions.</p>
