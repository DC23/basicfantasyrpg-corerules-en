  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from the
    caster's fingertip and strike its target, which must be at least partially
    visible to the caster, dealing 1d6+1 points of damage. The missile strikes
    unerringly. Specific parts of a creature can&rsquo;t be singled out.
    Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.</p>

    <p>For every three caster levels beyond 1 st, an additional missile is fired
    &ndash; two at 4th level, three at 7th , four at 10th, and the maximum of
    five missiles at 13 th level or higher. If the caster fires multiple
    missiles, he or she can target a single creature or several creatures. A
    single missile can strike only one creature. Targets must be designated
    before damage is rolled.</p>
