  description: >-
    <p>Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a
    creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield,
    weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature
    afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain
    special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by
    a caster of a certain level.</p>

    <p>The reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to place a
    curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster
    must choose one of the following three effects:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>&ndash;4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).</li>

    <li>&ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.</li>

    <li>Each round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally;
    otherwise, it takes no action.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more
    powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be
    dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell.</p>
