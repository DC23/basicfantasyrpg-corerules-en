  description: >-
    <p>This spell enables the caster to see into another area through the eyes
    of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and
    approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60' away. If there is no
    appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is
    allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The
    caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed,
    enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out
    of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another
    target in this case.</p>
