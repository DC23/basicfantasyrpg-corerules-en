  description: >-
    <p>The caster summons an <strong>invisible stalker</strong> to do his or her
    bidding (see the <strong>Monsters</strong> section, below, for details). The
    spell persists until <strong>dispel evil</strong> is cast on the creature,
    it is slain, or the task is fulfilled. The GM is advised to review the
    monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is used, as they may
    not always be reliable servants.</p>
