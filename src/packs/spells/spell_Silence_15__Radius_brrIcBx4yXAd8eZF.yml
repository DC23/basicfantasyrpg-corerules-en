  description: >-
    <p>Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within a 15'
    radius around the target. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible,
    spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or
    passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, making
    the effect stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can
    be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature
    and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a save vs. Spells to
    negate the spell. If an item in another creature&rsquo;s possession is
    targeted, that creature also receives a save vs. Spells to negate. This
    spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or
    spells.</p>
