  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The
    wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, one inch thick, per
    caster level. If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any
    surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall
    cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
    another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can
    be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in
    contact with the ground.</p>

    <p>The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate
    reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area.
    The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the
    wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface,
    so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The
    wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures
    can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A
    creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or
    several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll
    rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.)
    Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful
    saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size
    or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot
    crush larger creatures.</p>

    <p>Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other
    natural phenomena.</p>
