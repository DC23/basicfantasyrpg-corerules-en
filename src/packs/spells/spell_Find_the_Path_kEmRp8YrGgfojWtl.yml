  description: >-
    <p>The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical
    route to a specified destination. The caster must have some knowledge about
    the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as
    well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a
    location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.</p>

    <p>The locale can be outdoors or underground. <strong>Find the path</strong>
    works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The location must
    be on the same plane as the caster at the time of casting.</p>

    <p>The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will
    eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the
    exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell
    enables the subject to detect secret doors and to know any passwords
    required. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration
    expires, whichever comes first.</p>
