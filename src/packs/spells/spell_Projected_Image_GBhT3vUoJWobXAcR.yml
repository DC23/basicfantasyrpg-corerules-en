  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. The
    intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in
    addition to mimicking gestures and actions (including speech). Any further
    spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster. A
    line of sight between the caster and his or her illusory self must be
    maintained or the spell ends. <strong>Dimension door</strong>,
    <strong>teleport</strong>, or any similar spell that breaks the line of
    sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in
    combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster;
    for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see
    something the caster can't directly see, the caster does not see it. Also,
    all spell ranges are still figured from the caster's actual position, not
    the illusory self's position.</p>
