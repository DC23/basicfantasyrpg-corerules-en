  description: >-
    <p>The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical missile
    attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or other such are not
    blocked, but any number of normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts,
    thrown daggers, etc. will be fended off. Note that normal missiles projected
    by magic bows count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.</p>
