  description: >-
    <p>Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, filling a
    volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight 10'x10'x10' cubes). The
    strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses
    must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or
    else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation,
    the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the
    limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose
    to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a
    web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web
    won&rsquo;t cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the
    affected area will.</p>

    <p>Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs.
    Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not
    prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement
    rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal
    attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide.
    Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be
    able to act normally again.</p>

    <p>If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can&rsquo;t move or
    perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however.
    Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able
    to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save
    vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial
    save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are
    trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.</p>

    <p>The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs
    alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent
    10' cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put
    out by some means). All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of
    fire damage from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free
    afterwards.</p>
