  description: >-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a well-known or
    clearly visualized object. He or she can search for general items, in which
    case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within
    range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed
    that particular item firsthand (not merely through divination such as
    clairvoyance or a crystal ball). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet
    of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.</p>
