  description: >-
    <p>Quest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or
    to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster.
    The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to
    take effect. While a quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or
    perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
    other course of activity.</p>

    <p>A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a
    quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the
    quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some
    service.</p>

    <p>The affected creature must follow the given instructions until the quest
    is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some
    open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions
    the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A
    clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p>

    <p>If the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours, it takes
    3d6 points of damage each day.</p>

    <p>A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a <strong>remove
    curse</strong> spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster
    of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. <strong>Dispel
    magic</strong> does not affect a <strong>quest</strong> spell.</p>
