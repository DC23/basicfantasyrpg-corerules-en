  description: >-
    <p>By casting magic jar, the caster places his or her soul in a gem or large
    crystal within spell range (known as the magic jar), leaving the body
    lifeless. The caster may then attempt to take control of a nearby living
    creature within spell range, forcing its soul into the magic jar. The caster
    may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body)
    and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when the caster's soul
    returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty.</p>

    <p>To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and the
    caster must know where it is, though he or she does not need to be able to
    see it. When the caster transfers his or her soul upon casting, the caster's
    body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a
    normal dead body would.</p>

    <p>Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by
    <strong>protection from evil</strong> or a similar ward. The subject is
    allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host leaves
    the caster's life force in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune
    to further attempts for the duration of the spell.</p>

    <p>If the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the host
    body, and the host&rsquo;s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The
    caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, attack
    bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability).
    The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and
    natural abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to make
    more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access to any
    extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body.</p>

    <p>If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken
    (whether by dispel magic or physical damage): If the jar is in range of the
    caster's body, the caster's spirit returns to its body. Otherwise, the
    caster's spirit departs (the caster dies). In either case, the spell
    ends.</p>

    <p>If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by <strong>dispel
    evil</strong>: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster's
    spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit returns to its body. The
    caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining
    duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body,
    the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar (and
    departs), and the host's body dies.</p>

    <p>If the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken: If the
    jar is in range of the host's body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's
    spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the host's spirit
    departs, and the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here
    that the spell has not ended. <strong>Dispel evil</strong> can still be used
    to drive the caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending
    the spell.</p>

    <p>In any case where the spell ends with the caster's body unoccupied by a
    spirit, that body does truly die.</p>
