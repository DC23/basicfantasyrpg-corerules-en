  description: >-
    <p>This spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted mouth
    that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event
    occurs. The message, which may be up to three words per caster level long,
    can be in any language known by the caster and can be delivered over a
    period of 10 minutes, at any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will
    resemble the caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use
    command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according
    to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the
    statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed
    upon a tree, rock, or any other object.</p>

    <p>The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to
    the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as
    detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used.
    Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can
    fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical
    darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats
    audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises
    or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they
    are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or
    class except by external garb.</p>

    <p>The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level
    caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet
    away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible
    triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.</p>
