  description: >-
    <p>This spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less regard the
    caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and demi-humans may be
    affected, regardless of level of ability. A save vs. Spells will negate the
    effect. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the
    caster or his or her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The
    spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person as if it were
    an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her words and actions in the most
    favorable way. The caster can try to give the subject orders, but it will
    not do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do, and further may receive an
    additional saving throw to overcome the magic (at the GM's discretion). The
    caster must speak the target's language to communicate any commands, or else
    be good at pantomiming; of course, if the caster is attacked, the charmed
    creature will act to protect its &ldquo;friend&rdquo; (though that could
    mean attacking the caster's enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster
    to a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; place). The target receives a new saving throw each
    day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its
    Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8 or less.</p>
