  description: >-
    <p>This spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of
    life. The animated objects then attack whomever or whatever the caster
    designates. This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.
    An animated object can be of any non-magical material. The caster can
    animate one object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level
    (i.e. 300 lbs. at 12 th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so on).</p>

    <p>The GM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in combat. In
    general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster.
    Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while
    larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM's discretion). As a
    special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll
    for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a movement
    rate of 10', and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking,
    hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the
    GM).</p>
