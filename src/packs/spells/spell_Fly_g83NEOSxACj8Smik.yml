  description: >-
    <p>The subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her normal
    ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The subject can ascend at
    half speed and descend at double speed, with the same maneuverability as the
    subject has when moving on the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell
    requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or
    cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither charge nor run,
    nor carry aloft more weight than his or her maximum load.</p>

    <p>Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the
    magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 120' per round for 1d10
    rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in that amount of time, he or she
    lands safely. If not, the subject falls the rest of the distance, taking
    normal falling damage. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the
    subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is dispelled.</p>
