  description: >-
    <p>Heal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It
    immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting
    the target: ability damage, blindness, confusion, deafness, disease,
    exhaustion or fatigue, feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also
    restores all but 1d4 of the target's hit points. Heal does not remove
    negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.</p>

    <p>The reversed spell, harm, injures the creature touched so horribly that
    it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal
    attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if
    the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she
    will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which
    harm may kill a creature).</p>

    <p>Generally, both heal and harm only affect living creatures. If used
    against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm
    affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either
    spell.</p>
