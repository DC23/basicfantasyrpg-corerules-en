  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates an invisible, slightly concave circular plane of force
    for carrying loads. It is about the size of a shield, being 3 feet in
    diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold a maximum of 500 pounds
    of weight. (Note that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must
    be loaded so that the items placed upon it are properly supported, or they
    will (of course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over 62
    gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other reasonable
    container that can be placed upon the disc. Similarly, a pile of loose coins
    will tend to slip and slide about, and some will fall off with every step
    the caster takes; but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain
    stable.</p>

    <p>The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster's
    waist. It remains still when within 10' of the caster, and follows at the
    caster's movement rate if he or she moves away from it. The floating disc
    can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow
    moved more than 10' from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the
    disc disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to the
    surface beneath.</p>
