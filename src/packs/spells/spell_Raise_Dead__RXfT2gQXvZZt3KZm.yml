  description: >-
    <p>This spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or humanoid. The
    caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day
    per caster level. In addition, the subject&rsquo;s soul must be free and
    willing to return. If the subject&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the
    spell does not work.</p>

    <p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses
    one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently (i.e. it does not
    accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to
    the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If
    the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this
    would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be raised). This
    level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means,
    though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal
    fashion.</p>

    <p>Also note, a character who died with spells prepared has none prepared
    upon being raised.</p>

    <p>A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current hit
    dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising
    the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell
    closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of
    the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still
    missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead
    creature&rsquo;s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this
    spell.</p>

    <p>A creature which has become undead can&rsquo;t be raised by this spell.
    Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a
    creature that has died of old age.</p>

    <p>The reverse of this spell, <strong>slay living</strong>, will kill
    instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human,
    demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If the saving
    throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack
    roll is required to apply this spell in combat.</p>
