  description: >-
    <p>This powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures from the
    nether planes, hereafter called &ldquo;evil creatures.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>First, the caster gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against attacks by evil
    creatures.</p>

    <p>Second, the caster can choose to drive an evil creature back to its home
    plane by touch (requiring a successful attack roll). The creature can negate
    the effects with a successful save vs. Spells. This use discharges and ends
    the spell, even if the saving throw succeeds.</p>

    <p>Third, with a touch the caster can automatically dispel any one spell
    cast by an evil creature. Exception: Spells that can&rsquo;t be dispelled by
    dispel magic also can&rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel evil. Saving throws do
    not apply to this effect. This use also ends the spell.</p>

    <p>The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide; however,
    extraplanar creatures that oppose the caster should almost always
    qualify.</p>
