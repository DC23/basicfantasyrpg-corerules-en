  description: >-
    <p>This spell permits the caster to detect the surface thoughts of one or
    more targets within range. The caster must designate a direction, and then
    concentrate for a turn in order to &ldquo;hear&rdquo; the thoughts. Each
    turn the caster may choose to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; in a different direction.
    The caster may stop listening, then resume again later, so long as the
    duration has not expired. The target creature is not normally aware of being
    spied upon in this way.</p>

    <p>Rock more than 2 inches thick or a thin coating of lead or gold will
    block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this effect, as are
    mindless creatures such as golems.</p>
