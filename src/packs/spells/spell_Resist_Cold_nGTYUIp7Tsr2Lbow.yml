  description: >-
    <p>This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold. Minor cold
    (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) is ignored by
    the affected creature. Against more significant cold (such as the breath of
    a White Dragon), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws,
    and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).</p>
