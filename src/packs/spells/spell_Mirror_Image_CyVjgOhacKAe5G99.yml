  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster. The images
    move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly,
    making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real. A total
    of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images
    total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and remain in a
    cluster around him or her. The figments mimic the caster's actions,
    pretending to cast spells, drink potions, levitate, and so on, just as the
    caster does. Figments always look exactly like the caster.</p>

    <p>Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always
    hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image destroys it, whether the
    attack roll is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon
    a figment will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells
    are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments
    exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected
    to a <strong>fireball</strong>, all figments will appear to be injured just
    as the caster was.</p>
