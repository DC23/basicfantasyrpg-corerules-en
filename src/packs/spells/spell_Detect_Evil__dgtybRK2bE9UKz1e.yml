  description: >-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can
    detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments,
    and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even
    &ldquo;bad&rdquo; characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only
    overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the &ldquo;evil&rdquo;
    creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot
    be seen by anyone else.</p>

    <p>The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note that
    items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not &ldquo;evil,&rdquo; and thus
    not detectable by this spell.</p>

    <p>Reversed, this spell becomes <strong>detect good</strong>, which works
    just as described above with respect to detecting &ldquo;good&rdquo;
    enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.</p>
