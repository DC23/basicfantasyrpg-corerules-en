  description: >-
    <p>This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any written
    language. It may be cast in one of three modes:</p>

    <p>In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any number of
    written works in a variety of languages. This mode lasts for 1 turn per
    caster level.</p>

    <p>In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one book or
    tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.</p>

    <p>In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one
    non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is
    permanent.</p>

    <p>This spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as spell
    scrolls or spellbooks; see read magic, below, for the correct spell to use
    in such cases.</p>

    <p>The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way
    hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn't
    otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function,
    there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language
    somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that
    creature's mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables
    the spell to function.</p>
