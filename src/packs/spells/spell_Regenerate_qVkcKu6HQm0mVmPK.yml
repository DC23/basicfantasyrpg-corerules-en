  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes the subject&rsquo;s severed body members (fingers,
    toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded
    creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow back. After the spell is
    cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed
    members are present and touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is
    required for the regeneration to complete.</p>

    <p>This spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no effect on
    nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).</p>
