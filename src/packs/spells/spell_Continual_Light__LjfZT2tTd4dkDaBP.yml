  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full
    daylight up to a 30' radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of
    60'. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a
    creature, just as with the <strong>light</strong> spell, up to a maximum
    range of 360' from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per
    level of the caster.</p>

    <p>As with <strong>light</strong>, this spell can be used to blind a
    creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are
    allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into
    the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the
    blinded creature's attack rolls if the saving throw fails.</p>

    <p>The reversed spell, <strong>continual darkness</strong>, causes complete
    absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources.
    Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual
    light.</p>
