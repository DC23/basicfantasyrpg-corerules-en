  description: >-
    <p>This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they
    actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices
    secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects,
    sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or
    objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of
    polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing
    conferred is 120 feet.</p>

    <p>True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way
    confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment,
    including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects
    cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing
    through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairvoyance.</p>
