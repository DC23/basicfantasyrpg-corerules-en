  description: >-
    <p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight,
    including Darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that
    vanishes, too. If the spell is cast on someone else, neither the caster nor
    his or her allies can see the subject, unless they can normally see
    invisible things or employ magic to do so.</p>

    <p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items
    picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the
    creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of
    light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible
    source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more
    than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not
    magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient
    detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).</p>

    <p>The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts any spell.
    Actions (other than spellcasting) directed at unattended objects do not
    break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. The spell lasts
    at most 24 hours.</p>
