  description: >-
    <p>The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster that is in
    sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which
    monster he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to
    understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able
    to understand the caster. The spell doesn&rsquo;t alter the monster&rsquo;s
    reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more intelligent
    monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones
    make inane comments. If a monster is friendly toward the caster, it may
    decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant
    creatures and undead are unaffected by this spell.</p>
