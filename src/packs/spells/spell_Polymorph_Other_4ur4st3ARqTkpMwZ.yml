  description: >-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to change one target into another form of
    living creature. The assumed form can&rsquo;t have more hit dice than
    caster&rsquo;s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike <strong>polymorph
    self</strong>, the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental
    traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities
    of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of
    such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not
    remember its former life.</p>

    <p>The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously
    had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. Incorporeal or gaseous
    creatures are immune to this spell, as noted above. A creature with shape
    changing abilities such as a doppleganger can revert to its natural form in
    one round.</p>

    <p>Unwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are not
    affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the creature is slain,
    at which time the target reverts to his or her original form.</p>
