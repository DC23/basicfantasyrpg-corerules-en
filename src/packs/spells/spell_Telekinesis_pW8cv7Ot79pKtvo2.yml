  description: >-
    <p>This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by
    concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds per caster
    level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect
    on itself or an object it holds or has on its body with a successful save
    vs. Death Ray. In order to use this power, the caster must maintain
    concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no
    attacks and casting no spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentional
    or not), the power may be used again on the next round, but the subject of
    the effect is allowed a new saving throw.</p>
