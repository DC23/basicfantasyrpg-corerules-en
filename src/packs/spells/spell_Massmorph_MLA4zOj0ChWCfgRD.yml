  description: >-
    <p>With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller) creatures
    per four caster levels to appear as if they are natural effects of the
    terrain (for example, trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral
    underwater, boulders in a cavern, etc.). All creatures to be affected must
    be within a 120' radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only
    those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if
    they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself or herself
    among the affected creatures.</p>

    <p>Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing through
    the area for so long as they remain still. If an affected creature chooses
    to move or attack, the illusion is dispelled for that creature, but those
    who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early
    if he or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also be
    ended by <strong>dispel magic</strong>.</p>
