  description: >-
    <p>Listen is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to listen for
    distant sounds in a dungeon. The GM must decide what noises the Thief might
    hear; a successful roll means only that a noise could have been heard. The
    GM should always make this roll for the player. Note that the Thief and his
    or her party must try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this
    ability.</p>

    <p>Finally, Thieves can perform a Sneak Attack any time they are behind an
    opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn't know the
    Thief is there. The GM may require a Move Silently or Hide roll to determine
    this. The Sneak Attack is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage
    if it is successful. A Thief usually can't make a Sneak Attack on the same
    opponent twice in any given combat.</p>

    <p>The Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not missile)
    weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case subduing damage is
    done; see the Encounter section for details). Also, the Sneak Attack can be
    performed with the &ldquo;flat of the blade;&rdquo; the bonuses and
    penalties cancel out, so the attack has a +0 attack bonus and does normal
    damage; the damage done in this case is subduing damage.</p>
