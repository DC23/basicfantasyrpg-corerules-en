  description: >-
    <p><strong>Remove Traps</strong> is generally rolled twice: first to detect
    the trap, and second to disarm it. The GM will make these rolls as the
    player won't know for sure if the character is successful or not until
    someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected) area.</p>
