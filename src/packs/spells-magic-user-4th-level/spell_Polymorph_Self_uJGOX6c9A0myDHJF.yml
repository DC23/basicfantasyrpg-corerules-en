  description: >-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to change into another form of living
    creature. The assumed form can&rsquo;t have more hit dice than the caster's
    level. The caster can&rsquo;t assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. If
    slain, the caster reverts to his or her original form.</p>

    <p>The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form
    but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she also gains all
    physical attacks possessed by the form but does not gain any special,
    supernatural or spell-like abilities. Dragon breath is a special ability,
    for instance, so were the caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she
    could use the dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not
    the dragon's breath.</p>

    <p>The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of ability, or
    may choose to end the spell whenever he or she desires (up to one hour per
    level, of course).</p>
