  description: >-
    <p>The caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself, or any
    single target creature within range, to any spot within 200' plus 20' per
    caster level. The caster or target creature always arrives at exactly the
    spot desired, whether the caster visualizes the area or states direction and
    distance. An unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being
    transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target creature will
    be transported also, including another character or creature if the
    transportee can lift it. If the target area is within a solid object, the
    spell fails automatically.</p>
