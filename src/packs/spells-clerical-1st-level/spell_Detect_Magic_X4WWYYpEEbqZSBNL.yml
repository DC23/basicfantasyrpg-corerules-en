  description: >-
    <p>The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects
    or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a
    pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or
    objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the
    invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly
    allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack
    penalty of only -2.</p>
