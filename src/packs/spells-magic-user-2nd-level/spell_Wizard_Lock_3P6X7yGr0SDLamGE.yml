  description: >-
    <p>A <strong>wizard lock</strong> spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal
    magically locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own wizard lock
    without affecting it, as can any Magic-User 3 or more levels higher than the
    caster of the wizard lock; otherwise, a door or object secured with this
    spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful <strong>dispel
    magic</strong> or <strong>knock</strong> spell.</p>
