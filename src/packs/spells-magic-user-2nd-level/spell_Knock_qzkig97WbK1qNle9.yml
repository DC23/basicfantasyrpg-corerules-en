  description: >-
    <p>The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard locked
    doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or
    chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to
    hold shut something which can be opened). If used to open a wizard locked
    door, the spell does not remove the wizard lock but simply suspends its
    functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not relock
    itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not raise a portcullis
    or operate any other similar mechanism, nor will it affect ropes, vines, and
    the like. Each spell can undo a single means of preventing access.</p>
