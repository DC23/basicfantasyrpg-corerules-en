        <p>The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the plant

        find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal

    <p>No. of Attacks: 1 plus blood drain</p>

    <p>Damage: 1d6</p>

    <p>Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated
    plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These plants are always in bloom,
    bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in
    color.</p>

    <p>The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the plant in
    ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find
    locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal
    conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs. Poison or
    become befuddled, dropping anything carried and approaching the plant. Each
    round such a creature or character is within the affected area, this save
    must be made. Befuddled characters will not resist the plant-creature's
    attacks; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the
    fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc.
    are not affected.</p>

    <p>Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with
    thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the
    victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A
    blood rose which has recently (within one day) &ldquo;eaten&rdquo; this way
    will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will
    fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has
    consumed.</p>
