  biography: >-
    <p>A basilisk is an eight-legged reptilian monster that petrifies living
    creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a
    yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the
    nose. An adult basilisk&rsquo;s body grows to about 6 feet long, not
    including its tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The
    creature weighs about 300 pounds.</p>

    <p>Any living creature which meets the gaze of the basilisk must save vs.
    Petrification or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature
    surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the
    monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to
    AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the
    penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own
    reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone;
    a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively
    avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes
    closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror
    it may see its reflection.</p>
