  biography: >-
    <p>An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large group of
    ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit. In general, a swarm
    fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes, though it is possible for a swarm
    to become more compact in order to move through a small doorway or narrow
    corridor. If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10'
    squares and the flying movement above is ignored.</p>

    <p>Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm suffers 1d3
    points of damage each round. Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is
    unarmored (for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature having less
    than Armor Class 15 is considered unarmored).</p>

    <p>Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the
    character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to &ldquo;ward
    off&rdquo; the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized
    object around, and in this case also damage is reduced to 1 point per round.
    If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round.
    Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm
    can be affected by a <strong>sleep</strong> spell. Smoke can be used to
    drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s)&nbsp;due to
    smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water
    will take damage for only one more round.</p>
