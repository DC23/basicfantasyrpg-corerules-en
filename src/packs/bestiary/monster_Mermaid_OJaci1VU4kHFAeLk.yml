        <p>A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally
        has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs.
        Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous
        intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a
        penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit.
        Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires
        of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's
        temperament.</p>

  biography: >-
    <p>Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of dolphins.
    Also called &ldquo;sirens,&rdquo; mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or
    other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their
    enchanting songs.</p>

    <p>A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has
    no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs. Spells to
    resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as
    directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to
    the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to
    anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or
    slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.</p>

    <p>Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish)
    and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of
    light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However,
    being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4
    points of damage per turn.</p>

    <p>Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging
    from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest
    frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate
    with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of
    one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.</p>

    <p>Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are
    male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put
    ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother.
    Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females.
    A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around
    such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is
    called a pod.</p>

    <p>One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense
    this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a
    fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This
    explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be
    infertile.</p>

    <p>A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain
    in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of
    mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles
    (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet
    mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.</p>

    <p>Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and
    harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and
    about 3% have some Clerical abilities.</p>
