    <p>No. of Attacks: 2 claws/1 bite</p>

    <p>Damage: 1d6/1d6/2d6</p>

    <p>Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; roc is
    huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan of 24 feet. Large rocs
    are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs
    average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A
    roc&rsquo;s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. Like
    most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller
    in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be
    hidden, that is).</p>

    <p>A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300
    pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a
    normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy
    load up to 1200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3000 pounds, and are
    heavily loaded when carrying up to 6000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying
    off full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young
    elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.</p>

    <p>A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its
    powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any
    successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature
    results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is
    too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be
    further attacked, so as to be as &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; as possible when given
    to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary). A
    solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any man-sized or larger
    creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert,
    fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.</p>
