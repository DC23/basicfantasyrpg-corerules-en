  biography: >-
    <p>A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from her head
    instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it
    unless a save vs. Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised
    by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster
    while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to
    AC. It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other reflective
    surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to
    attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must
    save vs. Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to
    petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to
    petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or
    other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an
    attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her
    reflection.</p>

    <p>Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs. Poison
    or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per
    round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).</p>

    <p>A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face
    behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the
    same weight as a human.</p>

    <p>Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the
    lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is
    slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many
    humans as they can without being discovered.</p>
