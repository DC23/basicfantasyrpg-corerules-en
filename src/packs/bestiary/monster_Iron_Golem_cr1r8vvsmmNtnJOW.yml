    <p>No. of Attacks: 1 + special</p>

    <p>Damage: 4d10 + special</p>

    <p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one
    involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces. The animating
    force for a golem is an elemental spirit. The process of creating the golem
    binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the
    golem&rsquo;s creator.</p>

    <p>Being mindless, golems generally do nothing without orders from their
    creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any
    strategy or tactics. A golem&rsquo;s creator can command it if the golem is
    within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not actively commanded,
    a golem usually follows its last instruction to&nbsp;the best of its
    ability, though if attacked it returns the&nbsp;attack. The creator can give
    the golem a simple command&nbsp;to govern its actions in his or her absence.
    The golem&rsquo;s&nbsp;creator can order the golem to obey the commands
    of&nbsp;another person (who might in turn place the golem under&nbsp;someone
    else&rsquo;s control, and so on), but the golem&rsquo;s creator&nbsp;can
    always resume control over his creation by&nbsp;commanding the golem to obey
    him alone.</p>

    <p>Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except
    when otherwise noted. They can only be hit by magical weapons.</p>

    <p>This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can be
    fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below), although it
    almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother
    than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in
    one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An
    iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any
    distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step
    causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.</p>

    <p>Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a 10-foot
    cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of effect must save vs.
    Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be used up to 3 times per day.</p>

    <p>A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as
    the <strong>slow</strong> spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A
    magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem
    and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 full points of damage the attack
    would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to
    exceed its full normal hit points, the excess is ignored. For example, an
    iron golem hit by a fireball gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is
    19 points. An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that
    of a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each hit (with no
    saving throw normally allowed).</p>
