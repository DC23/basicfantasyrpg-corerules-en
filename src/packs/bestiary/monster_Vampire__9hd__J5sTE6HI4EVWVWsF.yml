    <p>No. of Attacks: 1 weapon or special</p>

    <p>Damage: 1d8 or by weapon or special</p>

    <p>Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are
    often hardened and feral, with the predatory ook of wolves. They often
    embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite
    their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no
    shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they
    knew in life.</p>

    <p>A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. Spells is
    allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm.
    This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by
    the vampire.</p>

    <p>The bite inflicts 1d3 damage, then each round thereafter one energy level
    is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates a 1d6 hit points (if
    needed) for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy
    drain, he or she will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less
    than 12 hours later). Vampires spawned in this way are under the permanent
    control of the vampire who created them.</p>

    <p>If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor
    Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the
    bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus
    of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and a vampire will generally
    choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than
    attempting to bite.</p>

    <p>Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are
    immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong> and
    <strong>hold</strong> spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the
    vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin
    to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming
    normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.</p>

    <p>Vampires command the lesser creatures of the night and once per day can
    call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack
    of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). These creatures
    arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.</p>

    <p>A vampire can assume the form of a <strong>giant bat</strong> or a
    <strong>dire wolf</strong> at will, requiring one round to complete the
    transformation. The flying movement listed is for the giant bat form. In
    animal form, the vampire can use the normal attacks for that form. It can't
    use its other powers while in animal form, except that creatures summoned
    are still controlled, and charms already in effect continue in effect.</p>

    <p>For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses:</p>

    <p><strong>Repelling a Vampire</strong>: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong
    odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they
    recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things
    don&rsquo;t harm the vampire &ndash; they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling
    vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or
    holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature
    holding the item for the rest of the encounter.</p>

    <p>Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be
    carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship. They are
    utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by
    someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places,
    since these are by definition open to all.</p>

    <p><strong>Slaying a Vampire</strong>: Reducing a vampire&rsquo;s hit points
    to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn&rsquo;t always destroy it, as
    described above. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any
    vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can act for only one round and
    is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly,
    immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points
    each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion.
    Driving a wooden stake through a vampire&rsquo;s heart instantly slays the
    monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the
    body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described above, or by burning it
    completely in a funeral pyre.</p>
