        <p>When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each
        round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk.
        The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living
        creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is
        within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The
        golem&rsquo;s creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by
        speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem; he or she must make a
        save vs. Spells to succeed at this, and at least 1 round of time is
        required for each check. It takes 1 round of inactivity by the golem to
        reset the golem&rsquo;s berserk chance to 0%.</p>

    <p>No. of Attacks: 4 weapons</p>

    <p>Damage: 1d6/1d6/1d6/1d6 or by weapon</p>

    <p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one
    involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces. The animating
    force for a golem is an elemental spirit. The process of creating the golem
    binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the
    golem&rsquo;s creator.</p>

    <p>Being mindless, golems generally do nothing without orders from their
    creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any
    strategy or tactics. A golem&rsquo;s creator can command it if the golem is
    within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not actively commanded,
    a golem usually follows its last instruction to&nbsp;the best of its
    ability, though if attacked it returns the&nbsp;attack. The creator can give
    the golem a simple command&nbsp;to govern its actions in his or her absence.
    The golem&rsquo;s&nbsp;creator can order the golem to obey the commands
    of&nbsp;another person (who might in turn place the golem under&nbsp;someone
    else&rsquo;s control, and so on), but the golem&rsquo;s creator&nbsp;can
    always resume control over his creation by&nbsp;commanding the golem to obey
    him alone.</p>

    <p>Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except
    when otherwise noted. They can only be hit by magical weapons.</p>

    <p>Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created from the skeletons of at
    least two dead humanoids. Though made of bone, they are not undead and
    cannot be turned.</p>

    <p>Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed with two
    two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a damage figure of
    1d10/1d10 or by weapon.</p>

    <p>When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each
    round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The
    uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature
    or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach,
    then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem&rsquo;s creator, if
    within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and
    persuasively to the golem; he or she must make a save vs. Spells to succeed
    at this, and at least 1 round of time is required for each check. It takes 1
    round of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem&rsquo;s berserk chance
    to 0%.</p>
