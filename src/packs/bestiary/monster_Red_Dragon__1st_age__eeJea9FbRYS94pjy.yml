    <p>Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters.
    Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how
    experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian
    monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as
    they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age
    categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average.
    For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each
    dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their
    various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>

    <p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female
    ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1
    to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a
    mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the
    case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting
    their young.</p>

    <p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike
    tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the
    wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath
    weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more
    intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the&nbsp;opposition and
    eliminating the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off
    weaker enemies).</p>

    <p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per&nbsp;day as it
    has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age&nbsp;category do not yet
    have a breath weapon. The breath&nbsp;may be used no more often than every
    other round, and&nbsp;the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same
    time.&nbsp;The tail swipe attack may only be used if there
    are&nbsp;opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be&nbsp;used only
    on those opponents in front of the creature.&nbsp;Due to their serpentine
    necks, dragons may bite in any&nbsp;direction, even behind them.</p>

    <p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of&nbsp;damage per hit die
    (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points&nbsp;of damage with its breath).
    Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath
    weapon may&nbsp;be projected in any direction around the dragon,
    even&nbsp;behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite
    those&nbsp;behind it.</p>

    <p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a&nbsp;dragon's breath
    weapon can cover. Each variety has a&nbsp;&ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which
    that type of dragon can use from&nbsp;the second age category (-2 hit dice)
    onward. Upon&nbsp;reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a
    dragon&nbsp;learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the
    other&nbsp;shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3
    hit&nbsp;dice), the dragon is competent at producing all
    three&nbsp;shapes.</p>

    <p>The shapes are:</p>

    <p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's
    mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum
    length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that
    point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>

    <p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends
    the given length in a straight line.</p>

    <p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up
    to&nbsp;the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and&nbsp;age) in
    both length and width (that is, the length figure&nbsp;given for the dragon
    type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep
    or high.</p>

    <p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are&nbsp;able to
    speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of&nbsp;&ldquo;talking;&rdquo;
    this is the chance that the dragon will know&nbsp;Common or a demi-human or
    humanoid language. Many&nbsp;who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first
    roll for &ldquo;talking&rdquo;&nbsp;is successful, the GM may roll again,
    with each additional&nbsp;roll adding another language which the dragon may
    speak.</p>

    <p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon&nbsp;can cast
    spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will&nbsp;learn to speak to
    lesser creatures, but each is rolled for&nbsp;separately.</p>

    <p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all&nbsp;dragons are
    covetous.&nbsp;They like to hoard wealth,&nbsp;collecting mounds of coins
    and gathering as many gems,&nbsp;jewels, and magic items as possible. Those
    with large&nbsp;hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out
    of&nbsp;their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get
    food.&nbsp;For dragons, there is no such thing as enough
    treasure.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its
    radiance.&nbsp;Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping
    nooks&nbsp;and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for
    most&nbsp;monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of
    average&nbsp;numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a
    single&nbsp;individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs
    do&nbsp;not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure&nbsp;amounts
    for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of&nbsp;the dragon; a dragon
    of the highest age category would&nbsp;have about double the given amount,
    while one of the&nbsp;next to lowest age category would have perhaps a
    tenth&nbsp;that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>

    <p>Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause&nbsp;to appraise
    an adversary. On spotting a target, they make&nbsp;a snap decision whether
    to attack, using one of many&nbsp;strategies worked out ahead of time. A red
    dragon lands&nbsp;to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and
    bite&nbsp;rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so
    as&nbsp;not to destroy any treasure they might be carrying.</p>

    <p>Red dragons are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt, torment, kill
    and consume intelligent creatures. They are often said to prefer women and
    elves, but in truth a red&nbsp;dragon will attack almost any creature less
    powerful than&nbsp;itself.</p>

    <p>Red dragons are immune to normal fire, and suffer only&nbsp;half damage
    from magical fire.</p>
