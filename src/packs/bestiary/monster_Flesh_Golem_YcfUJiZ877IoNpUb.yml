    <p>No. of Attacks: 2 fists</p>

    <p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one
    involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces. The animating
    force for a golem is an elemental spirit. The process of creating the golem
    binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the
    golem&rsquo;s creator.</p>

    <p>Being mindless, golems generally do nothing without orders from their
    creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any
    strategy or tactics. A golem&rsquo;s creator can command it if the golem is
    within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not actively commanded,
    a golem usually follows its last instruction to&nbsp;the best of its
    ability, though if attacked it returns the&nbsp;attack. The creator can give
    the golem a simple command&nbsp;to govern its actions in his or her absence.
    The golem&rsquo;s&nbsp;creator can order the golem to obey the commands
    of&nbsp;another person (who might in turn place the golem under&nbsp;someone
    else&rsquo;s control, and so on), but the golem&rsquo;s creator&nbsp;can
    always resume control over his creation by&nbsp;commanding the golem to obey
    him alone.</p>

    <p>Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except
    when otherwise noted. They can only be hit by magical weapons.</p>

    <p>A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body parts,
    stitched together into a single composite form. No natural animal willingly
    tracks a flesh golem. The golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires,
    usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions and no
    weapons. It stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 500 pounds. A flesh golem
    cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and
    moves with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its
    body.</p>

    <p>When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each
    round that its elemental spirit will break free. Such a golem will go on a
    rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object
    smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to cause
    more destruction. The golem&rsquo;s creator, if within 60 feet, can try to
    regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem; he or she
    must make a save vs. Spells to succeed at this, and at least 1 round of time
    is required for each check. It takes 1 round of inactivity by the golem to
    reset the golem&rsquo;s berserk chance to 0%.</p>

    <p>A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as
    the <strong>slow</strong> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A
    magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the
    golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 full points of damage the
    attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem
    to exceed its full normal hit points, the excess is ignored. For example, a
    flesh golem hit by a lightning bolt heals 3 points of damage if the attack
    would have dealt 11 points of damage.</p>
