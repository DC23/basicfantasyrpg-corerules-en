  biography: >-
    <p>No. of Attacks: 1 pseudopod</p>

    <p>Damage: 3d8</p>

    <p>Black puddings are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They
    inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and
    dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. They attack any
    creatures they encounter, lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing
    opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch and
    digest their prey.</p>

    <p>If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or
    electricity, a black pudding suffers no injury, but will be split into two
    puddings; the GM should divide the original black pudding's hit dice between
    the two however he or she sees fit, with the limitation that neither pudding
    may have less than two hit dice. A two hit die black pudding is simply
    unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split further.</p>

    <p>Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding, but such an attack
    will paralyze the pudding for one round per die of damage the attack would
    normally cause. Other attack forms will affect a black pudding normally; the
    preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.</p>

    <p>The typical black pudding measures 10 feet across and 2 feet thick, and
    weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black puddings of smaller sizes may be
    encountered, possibly as a result of the splitting described above.</p>
