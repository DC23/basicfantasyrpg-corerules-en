    <p>Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters.
    Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how
    experts distinguish &ldquo;true&rdquo; dragons from other large reptilian
    monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as
    they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven &ldquo;age
    categories,&rdquo; ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average.
    For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each
    dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their
    various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>

    <p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female
    ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1
    to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a
    mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the
    case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting
    their young.</p>

    <p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike
    tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the
    wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath
    weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more
    intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating
    the most dangerous foes first(or avoiding them while picking off weaker
    enemies).</p>

    <p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit
    dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a
    breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round,
    and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe
    attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the
    claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to
    their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind
    them.</p>

    <p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so,
    a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may
    make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be
    projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same
    reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.</p>

    <p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath
    weapon can cover. Each variety has a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape, which that
    type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward.
    Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape
    its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh
    age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three
    shapes.</p>

    <p>The shapes are:</p>

    <p><strong>Cone Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's
    mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum
    length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that
    point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).</p>

    <p><strong>Line Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends
    the given length in a straight line.</p>

    <p><strong>Cloud Shaped</strong>: The breath weapon covers an area up to the
    maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and
    width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is
    ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.</p>

    <p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak
    Dragon. Each type has a given chance of &ldquo;talking;&rdquo; this is the
    chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid
    language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for
    &ldquo;talking&rdquo; is successful, the GM may roll again, with each
    additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>

    <p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells
    are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser
    creatures, but each is rolled for separately.</p>

    <p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous.
    They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many
    gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath
    to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the
    immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough
    treasure. It&rsquo;s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance.
    Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit
    their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a
    lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single
    individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure!
    Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters,
    adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would
    have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age
    category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no
    treasure).</p>

    <p>Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as
    cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to
    stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their
    aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out
    of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. Black
    dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by
    the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.</p>

    <p>Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the
    head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100'
    (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>

    <p>Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon may hold
    its breath up to three turns while lying in wait underwater.</p>
