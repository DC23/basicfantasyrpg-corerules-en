    <p>A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. A
    troll&rsquo;s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid
    gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray. They appear sexless
    if examined, and their method of reproduction is a mystery. Trolls walk
    upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven,
    and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this
    seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.</p>

    <p>Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of damage
    each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead,
    but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point.
    Note that the troll may &ldquo;play dead&rdquo; until it has regenerated
    further. Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at
    the normal rate; a troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The
    lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers
    armed with fire or acid. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost
    portion regrows in one turn; or, the creature can reattach the severed
    member instantly by holding it to the stump.</p>

    <p>Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though
    trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation
    of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws.</p>
