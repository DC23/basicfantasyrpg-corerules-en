    <p>Damage 1d8 + special</p>

    <p>Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one
    reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost normally
    resembles the form it had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is
    altered. For instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil
    might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts may be hit
    only&nbsp;by magical weapons.</p>

    <p>Seeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs. Spells or
    flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who successfully saves vs. a
    given ghost's fear attack may not be so affected by that ghost again, but of
    course may still be affected by another.</p>

    <p>A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points
    of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points.
    In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and
    other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs.
    Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit.
    Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting
    a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should
    assign whatever score he or she sees fit.</p>

    <p>Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of
    @Item[P9y1y3QaNCpBpqaG]{Restoration}; nothing else (except a
    <strong>wish</strong>) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a
    character's Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot
    be <strong>raised</strong> (but still may be
    <strong>reincarnated</strong>).</p>

    <p>Once per turn, a ghost can use
    @Item[pW8cv7Ot79pKtvo2]{Telekinesis}&nbsp;(as the spell) as if it were a
    10th level Magic-User.</p>

    <p>Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature.
