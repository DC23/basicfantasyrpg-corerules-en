  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes a thin, green ray to spring from the caster's pointing
    finger. Any single creature or object (up to a 10x10x10 foot cube of
    material) is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine
    dust. A disintegrated creature&rsquo;s equipment is unaffected.</p>

    <p>A creature that makes a successful save vs. Spells is unaffected. The ray
    can target only one creature per casting, if that target saves, the spell is
    wasted.</p>
