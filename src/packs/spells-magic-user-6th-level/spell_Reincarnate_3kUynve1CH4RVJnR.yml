    <p>With this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or humanoid
    creature) in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one
    week before the casting of the spell and the subject&rsquo;s soul is free
    and willing to return. If the subject&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return,
    the spell does not work.</p>

    <p>Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills
    and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor.
    So long as some small portion of the character&rsquo;s body still exists, it
    can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part
    of the character&rsquo;s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell
    creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the
    natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the
    body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.</p>

    <p>A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and
    form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom,
    and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be
    rerolled. (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range
    for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.)
    The subject&rsquo;s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real
    reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical
    <strong>restoration</strong>. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from
    the character's original hit point total; this is the new form's hit points.
    If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new
    Constitution score is reduced by 2.</p>

    <p>A character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a
    death effect can&rsquo;t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs,
    elementals, and undead creatures can&rsquo;t be reincarnated. The spell
    cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.</p>

    <p>The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new
    form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural
    attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn&rsquo;t
    automatically speak the language of the new form.</p>
