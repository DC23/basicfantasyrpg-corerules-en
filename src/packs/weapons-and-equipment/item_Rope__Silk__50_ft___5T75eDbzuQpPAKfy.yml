  description: >-
    <p>Silk Rope is about 3/8 inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of
    1,600 pounds, although it weighs considerably less than hemp rope.&nbsp;Safe
    working load for a rope is normally one-quarter of the breaking strength.
    One or more knots in a rope cut the breaking strength in half. This does not
    affect the safe working load, because knots are figured into the listed
    one-quarter ratio.</p>
