  description: >-
    <p>Hemp Rope is &frac12; inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of
    1,600 pounds. Safe working load for a rope is normally one-quarter of the
    breaking strength. One or more knots in a rope cut the breaking strength in
    half. This does not affect the safe working load, because knots are figured
    into the listed one-quarter ratio.</p>
