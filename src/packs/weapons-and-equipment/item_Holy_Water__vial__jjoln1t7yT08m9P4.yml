  description: >-
    <p>Holy water damages undead creatures. A flask of holy water can be thrown
    as a grenade-like missile; the flask breaks if thrown against the body of a
    corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, it must
    be opened and poured out onto the target, generally requiring the attacker
    to be adjacent to the target.</p>

    <p>A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 1d8 points of damage to an
    undead creature. In addition, each such creature within 5 feet of the point
    of impact receives 1d6 points of damage from the splash. Holy water is only
    effective for one round.</p>
