  description: >-
    <p>A Mirror is useful in a dungeon environment for many reasons; for
    instance, it is the only way to look at a Medusa without being turned to
    stone. Mirrors are also useful for looking around corners, and can be used
    outdoors to send signals using reflected sunlight.</p>
