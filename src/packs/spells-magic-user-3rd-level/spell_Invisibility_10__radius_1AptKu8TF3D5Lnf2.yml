  description: >-
    <p>This spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell confers
    invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center
    of the effect is mobile with the recipient.</p>

    <p>Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if
    unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who
    attack negate the invisibility only for themselves, but if the spell
    recipient attacks, the invisibility ends for all affected creatures. Any
    affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures
    moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible
    (including any previously affected creatures who have become visible as
    described above).</p>
