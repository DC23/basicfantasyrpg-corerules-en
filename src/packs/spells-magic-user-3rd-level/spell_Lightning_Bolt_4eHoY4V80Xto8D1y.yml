  description: >-
    <p>This spell releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6
    points of electricity damage per caster level to each creature within its
    area. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The bolt begins at the
    caster's fingertips and extends to the range given. The caster may choose to
    limit the range of the spell, but the minimum range is 60 feet. The
    lightning bolt passes through an area 5' wide, arcing and jumping, so that,
    while it is not actually 5' wide, for game purposes treat it as if it is
    so.</p>

    <p>The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its
    path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold,
    copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier
    shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if
    the spell&rsquo;s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier
    back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the GM's option.
    Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take additional
    damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.</p>
