  description: >-
    <p>The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast
    on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their
    effects) within a cubic area 20' on a side. The caster must choose whether
    to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.</p>

    <p>If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including
    ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such
    effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster
    level equal to or less than the <strong>dispel magic</strong> caster's level
    is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be
    canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the
    spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster
    dispelling magic created by a 14 th level caster has a 20% chance of
    failure.</p>

    <p>Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes
    any curse, including those created by bestow curse (the reverse of remove
    curse) as well as by cursed items.</p>
