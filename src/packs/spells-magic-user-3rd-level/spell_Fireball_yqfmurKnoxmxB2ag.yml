  description: >-
    <p>A fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low
    roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level to every creature
    within a spherical volume having a 20' radius. A save vs. Spells for half
    damage is allowed. The explosion creates almost no pressure.</p>

    <p>The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance and height)
    at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from
    the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid
    barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball
    at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If the
    caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through
    an arrow slit, he or she must roll a missile attack (without range
    adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the bead strikes the barrier and
    detonates prematurely.</p>

    <p>The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area.
    It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper,
    silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters
    or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier in order
    to attain its full volume.</p>
