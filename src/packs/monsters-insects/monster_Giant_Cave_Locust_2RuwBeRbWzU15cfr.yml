        <p>Can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away.
        Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter.
        This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale
        check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their

  biography: >-
    <p>Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live
    underground. An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are
    eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive
    feet and a variety of touch-sensitive &ldquo;hairs&rdquo; on their legs to
    sense the environment around them.</p>

    <p>These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as
    carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack,
    shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.</p>

    <p>All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting
    wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round
    that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are
    indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.</p>

    <p>Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will
    attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not
    interrupt the monster's shrieking.</p>

    <p>A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to 30' up. If
    one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will
    leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if
    the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage
    from the impact.</p>

    <p>Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its
    digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can perform this
    attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved
    until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave
    locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to
    flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls
    an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no
    normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs.
    Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible
    smell.</p>
