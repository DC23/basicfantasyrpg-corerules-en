  description: >-
    <p>Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very
    effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 10% chance they
    will be detected. Even indoors, in dungeons or in non-preferred terrain they
    are able to hide such that there is only a 30% chance of detection. Note
    that a Halfling Thief will roll only once, using either the Thief ability or
    the Halfling ability, whichever is better.</p>
