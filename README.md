# Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game Core Rules content for Basic Fantasy RPG for FoundryVTT

This is a content pack for [Basic Fantasy RPG system for Foundry VTT](https://www.github.com/orffen/basicfantasyrpg), it provides content from the book "Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game Core Rules" available for free under the OGL on the [Basic Fantasy Website](https://www.basicfantasy.org/)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project has been stalled on older versions of Foundry and the BFPRG 3rd edition for some time now. 
> The reasons for this are completely understandable. This is a volunteer project with time-consuming manual data entry
> requirements. Add to this two key external factors.
>
> First, Foundry development rolls ever on. Module developers must constantly keep up or their modules will stop working for all of you. Significantly, the Foundry data structures this module relies on have completely changed since this module was last updated. Everything now needs to change at the data storage level.
>
> Second, at the start of 2023 there was the great OGL Saga. As a response to this, the BFRPG Community rallied
> in a truly remarkable way, producing the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game 4th Edition, under a Creative Commons licence. This remarkable feat didn't require many mechanical changes, but it did result in significant changes to the text. Thus the required changes to this content module are huge. 
> 
> When I came on to assess the what was needed to bring this module up to date, I realised something. It doesn't need an update.
>
> It needs a complete overhaul.
>
> As a result, updates to Foundry v12 and beyond are being planned in two stages.
>
> 1. The v12 with BFRPG 3e content patch release. This release is aiming to do the barest minimum work required for v12 compatibility, but with the existing OGL BFRPG 3e content. The content will be updated to the new data structures using any means we can find.
> 2. The forward-facing, future-proof rebuilding effort. This is where most of the work will be going. The vision is to reduce the manual data entry required to keep the module updated by attempting to build semi-automated data pipelines. It's experimental, so time will tell how it goes!

## Notes on using this module

I recommend ticking "Keep Document ID's" when importing, this will allow the links to RollTables referenced in some of the spell descriptions to work.
