# Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game Core Rules content for Basic Fantasy RPG for FoundryVTT

This is a content pack for [Basic Fantasy RPG system for Foundry VTT](https://www.github.com/orffen/basicfantasyrpg), it provides content from the book "Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game Core Rules" available for free under the OGL on the [Basic Fantasy Website](https://www.basicfantasy.org/)

## Installation
As the core system, this module is not yet available via FoundryVTT, but it can be manually added by using the manifest link below:

## Notes on using this module
I recommend ticking "Keep Document ID's" when importing, this will allow the links to RollTables referenced in some of the spell descriptions to work.

## Early Development
Data entry takes ages, so this pack currently covers:
* Equipment
* Weapons
* Armor & Shields
* Spells

Monsters are being worked on, but it's eating a fair amount of time to do so.
