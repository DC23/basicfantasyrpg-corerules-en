They look like giant lizards with six legs. Their scales are the colors of ice, white, pale gray and pale blue. Frost salamanders are very cold, and all non-cold-resistant creatures within 20' suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the cold. Frost salamanders are completely immune to all types of cold-based attacks.
