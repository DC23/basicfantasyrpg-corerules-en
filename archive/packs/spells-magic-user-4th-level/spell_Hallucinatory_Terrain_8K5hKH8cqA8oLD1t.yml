  description: >-
    <p>This spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain appear
    like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the
    like). This spell requires a full turn to cast.</p>

    <p>The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of
    natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are
    not hidden or changed in appearance. A save vs. Spells is allowed to see
    through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected
    actively attempt to do so.</p>
