  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers,
    thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become thick and overgrown.
    The dimensions of the growth are determined by the caster, but cannot exceed
    1000 sq. feet (a 10'x100' area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The
    plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force
    a way through. All movement within the affected area is reduced to no more
    than 5&rsquo; per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized
    creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate. The area must have brush
    and/or trees in it for this spell to take effect.</p>

    <p>The reverse form, <strong>shrink plants</strong>, may be used to render
    overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal
    version.</p>

    <p>Growth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered, either by
    the opposite form or by <strong>dispel magic</strong>. This spell has no
    effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.</p>
