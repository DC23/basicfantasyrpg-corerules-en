  description: >-
    <p>With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical &ldquo;eye&rdquo;
    through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but otherwise sees
    exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can
    see, up to a range of 240' away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40'
    per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240'
    feet away from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass
    through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human's
    eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster
    must concentrate to use the eye.</p>
