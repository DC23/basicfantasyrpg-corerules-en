  description: >-
    <p>This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a magical
    slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not affected. The caster
    chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range, of course),
    and those creatures within 30' of the chosen point may be affected. Each
    creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the
    effect.</p>

    <p>Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected
    creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect unconscious
    creatures, constructs, or undead creatures, and such creatures in the area
    of effect are ignored.</p>

    <p>When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up
    immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings
    are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally, at the
    GM's option.</p>
