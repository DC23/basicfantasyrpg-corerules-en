  description: >-
    <p>This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6 points of
    additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack
    for the duration of the spell. It provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a
    normal weapon, the spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be
    affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such a monster,
    however.</p>
