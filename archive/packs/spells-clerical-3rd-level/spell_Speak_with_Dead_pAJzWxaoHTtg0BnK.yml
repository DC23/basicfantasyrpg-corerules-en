  description: >-
    <p>This spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse,
    allowing it to answer several questions that the caster puts to it. The
    caster may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are
    wasted if the duration expires. The corpse&rsquo;s knowledge is limited to
    what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if
    any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.</p>

    <p>If the corpse has been subject to <strong>speak with dead</strong> within
    the past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell on a
    corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be
    mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give
    partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a
    mouth in order to speak at all.</p>

    <p>This spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person (whose
    soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge
    &ldquo;stored&rdquo; in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the
    imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all
    the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot
    learn new information. Indeed, it can&rsquo;t even remember being
    questioned.</p>

    <p>This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead
    creature.</p>
