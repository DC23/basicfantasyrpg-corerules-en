    <p>Dry Rations may consist of dry bread, hard cheese, dried fruit, nuts,
    beans, jerky, or any other food which will not &ldquo;go bad&rdquo; in less
    than about a month (if not longer). Dry rations are generally sold in
    quantities sufficient for one character for a week, and are packaged in
    waxed or oiled cloth to protect them.</p>
