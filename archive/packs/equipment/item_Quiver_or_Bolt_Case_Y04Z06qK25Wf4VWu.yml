  description: >-
    <p>A Quiver is an open container used to hold arrows. A Bolt Case is a
    similar sort of container for crossbow bolts. In either case, the standard
    capacity is 20 missiles. The length of a quiver or bolt case must match the
    length of the ammunition for it to be useful; therefore, there are longbow
    and shortbow quivers and light and heavy crossbow bolt cases. The price is
    the same for all types.</p>
