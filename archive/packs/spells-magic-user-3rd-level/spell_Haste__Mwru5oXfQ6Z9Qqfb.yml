  description: >-
    <p>This spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster level. The
    affected creatures move and act twice as quickly as normal, having double
    their normal movement rates and making twice the normal attacks per round,
    for the duration of the spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the
    use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per
    round. Multiple haste or speed effects don&rsquo;t combine; only apply the
    most powerful or longest lasting effect.</p>
