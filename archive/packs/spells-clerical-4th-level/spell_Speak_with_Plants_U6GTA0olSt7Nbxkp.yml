  description: >-
    <p>The caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal plants and
    plant creatures. A normal plant&rsquo;s sense of its surroundings is
    limited, so it won&rsquo;t be able to give (or recognize) detailed
    descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its
    immediate vicinity. The spell doesn&rsquo;t alter the plant&rsquo;s reaction
    or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally
    communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance
    to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse and evasive,
    behaving in much the same fashion as any other monster. If a plant creature
    is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for
    him or her. Normal plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally
    perform &ldquo;services&rdquo; other than to answer questions.</p>
