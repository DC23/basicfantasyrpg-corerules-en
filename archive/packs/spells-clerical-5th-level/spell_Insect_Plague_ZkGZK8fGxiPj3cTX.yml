  description: >-
    <p>This spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels, to a
    maximum of six swarms at 18 th level. See Insect Swarm in the
    <strong>Monsters</strong> section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms
    must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm
    (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). The caster may summon
    the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm
    attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after
    being summoned.</p>
