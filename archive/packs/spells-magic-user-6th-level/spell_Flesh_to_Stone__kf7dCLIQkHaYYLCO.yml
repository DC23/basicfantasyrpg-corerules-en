  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes the subject, along with all its carried gear, to turn
    into a mindless, inert statue. A saving throw vs. Petrification is allowed
    to resist the spell. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or
    damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) suffers
    equivalent damage or deformities. Only creatures made of flesh are affected
    by this spell.</p>

    <p>The reverse spell, <strong>stone to flesh</strong>, acts as a
    counterspell for <strong>flesh to stone</strong>, restoring the creature
    just as it was when it was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone
    that is not the result of <strong>flesh to stone</strong> or similar
    petrification effects (such as a medusa's gaze).</p>
