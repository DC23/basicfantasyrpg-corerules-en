  description: >-
    <p>Geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or
    to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster.
    The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to
    take effect.</p>

    <p>While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that
    would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of
    activity.</p>

    <p>A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas
    when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas,
    typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.</p>

    <p>The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is
    completed, no matter how long it takes.</p>

    <p>If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient
    cannot complete through his or her own actions, the spell remains in effect
    for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert
    some instructions, at the GM's discretion.</p>

    <p>For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is
    prevented from obeying it), it suffers a &ndash;2 penalty to each of its
    ability scores, up to a total of &ndash;8. No ability score can be reduced
    to less than 3 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24
    hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.</p>

    <p>A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a <strong>remove
    curse</strong> spell, or by a <strong>wish</strong>, or by the reverse of
    this spell. Dispel magic does not affect a geas.</p>
