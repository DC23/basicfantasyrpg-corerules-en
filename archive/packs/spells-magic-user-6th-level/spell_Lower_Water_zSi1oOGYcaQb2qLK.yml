  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much
    as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is
    lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to
    10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep bodies of water,
    such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and
    similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to
    leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water
    elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a
    <strong>slow</strong> spell (the reverse of <strong>haste</strong>); a save
    vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the effect. The spell has no
    effect on other creatures.</p>
