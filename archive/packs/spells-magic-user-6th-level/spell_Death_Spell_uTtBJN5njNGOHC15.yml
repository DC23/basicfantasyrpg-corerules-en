  description: >-
    <p>This spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a 30' radius
    sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit). Excess
    levels of effectiveness are lost. Each creature affected is allowed to save
    vs. Death Ray; those that fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or
    more hit dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters,
    golems, and any other &ldquo;creature&rdquo; that is not truly alive.</p>
