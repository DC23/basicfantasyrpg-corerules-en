  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock
    surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, 1'
    thick, per caster level. The caster can double the wall&rsquo;s area by
    halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the
    same space as a creature or another object.</p>

    <p>The caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he or she
    desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm
    foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing
    stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For
    this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and
    buttressed, reducing the spell&rsquo;s area by half. The wall can also be
    crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by
    similarly reducing the area.</p>

    <p>Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
    <strong>disintegrate</strong> spell or by normal means such as breaking and
    chipping.</p>

    <p>It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a
    wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
    Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful saves vs. Death Ray.</p>
