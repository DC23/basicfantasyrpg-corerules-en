  description: >-
    <p>If the target creature fails a saving throw vs. Spells, its Intelligence
    and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to cast
    spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. The victim does
    remember who its friends are and can follow and protect them from harm. The
    subject remains in this state until a <strong>heal</strong> spell is used to
    cancel the effect. A target creature that can cast Magic-User spells suffers
    a penalty of -4 on its saving throw against this spell.</p>
