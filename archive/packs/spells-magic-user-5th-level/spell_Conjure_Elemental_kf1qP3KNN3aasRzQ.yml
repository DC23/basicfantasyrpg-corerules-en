  description: >-
    <p>A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is
    opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental from that plane. At
    most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in a given
    day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely,
    provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature;
    spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss
    of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can
    dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if
    in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned
    Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack
    the conjurer and all others in its path. Only <strong>dispel magic</strong>
    or <strong>dispel evil</strong> will banish the elemental once control has
    been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane
    on its own; such creatures will not choose to remain on the material plane
    for long.</p>
