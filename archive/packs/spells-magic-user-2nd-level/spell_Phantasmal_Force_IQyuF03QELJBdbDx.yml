  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature (or small
    group of creatures), or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a
    maximum size of 20'x20'x20'. The illusion does not create sound, smell,
    texture, or temperature. The caster can animate the image within the limits
    of the area of effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates
    upon it.</p>

    <p>If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have
    an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in combat. Damage done by
    monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real; those
    &ldquo;killed&rdquo; or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up uninjured
    (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will
    be equivalent to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.</p>

    <p>Attempting to animate more creatures than the caster's level grants
    viewing creatures with at least average Intelligence an immediate save vs.
    Spells to recognize the creatures as illusions; those making the save will
    be unaffected by any actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A
    similar save may be granted by the GM any time he or she feels the illusion
    is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion
    which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.</p>
