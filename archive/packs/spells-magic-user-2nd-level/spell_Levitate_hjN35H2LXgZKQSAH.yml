  description: >-
    <p>Levitate allows the caster to move himself or herself, another creature,
    or an object up and down as desired. A creature must be willing to be
    levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing
    creature. The caster can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as
    much as 20 feet each round, by concentration. The caster cannot move the
    recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a
    cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally
    at half its normal land speed).</p>

    <p>A levitating creature that attacks with a weapon finds itself
    increasingly unstable; the first attack has a &ndash;1 attack penalty, the
    second &ndash;2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of &ndash;5. A full round
    spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &ndash;1.</p>
