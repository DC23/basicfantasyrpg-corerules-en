  description: >-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in much the
    same fashion as <strong>charm person</strong>, at a rate of 1 hit die per
    caster level. The caster may decide which individual animals out of a mixed
    group are to be affected first; excess hit dice of effect are ignored. No
    saving throw is allowed, either for normal or giant-sized animals, but
    creatures of more fantastic nature (as determined by the GM) are allowed a
    save vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals will
    resume normal activity immediately.</p>

    <p>This spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication
    with the affected animals; if combined with <strong>speak with
    animals</strong>, this spell becomes significantly more useful.</p>
