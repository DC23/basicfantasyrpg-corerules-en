  description: >-
    <p>The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal (normal or
    giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster
    and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which animal he or she is
    speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn&rsquo;t alter the
    animal&rsquo;s reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction
    roll should be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals
    are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane
    comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward the caster, it may be
    willing to grant some favor or service.</p>
