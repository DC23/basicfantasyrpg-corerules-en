  description: >-
    <p>This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target creature is
    currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs.
    Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.</p>

    <p>The reverse of this spell, cause fear, causes one target creature within
    120' to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs. Spells, it flees
    for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this
    effect.</p>
